ICub Robot – Visual Attention System					        		     	     Spring 2018
•	Developed a program using YARP and OpenCV library in C++ to apply face detection, object detection, and linear filtering systems onto the ICub robot eye. We also simulated attention by allowing ICub eyes to look and follow a moving face.
